<p>I am slowly re-developing my original site <a href="jonhuml.com">jonhuml.com</a> due to its cookie cutter design,
but that site will always have my resume and small tidbits of personal information. I'd like to keep that site more
professional and this one more goofy. </p>
<p>I also believe that scientists (especially in fields like AI where noise is high) have a duty to
make their work more personal and more able to be understood by
people who don't study the subject everyday. </p>
<p>I'm not yet good at acting on this belief, but my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jonhuml/videos">Youtube</a> page and my
<a href="https://jonhuml.substack.com/">Substack</a> are becoming my primary tools for communication. Substack has pretty poor support
for math scripting, however, so I am liable to leave them soon. </p>
<p>You can also message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonhuml/">LinkedIn</a> and I'll usually respond. I have helped
multiple students look over grad school essays (God knows why they ask me), but please note I might be slow on this front. </p>
<p>As I'm a first year PhD student, my research history is still somewhat sparse, but you can also find me at my
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFocmRkAAAAJ&hl=en">Scholar</a> page. New papers are always forthcoming and my
<a href="https://github.com/jonathanhuml">Github</a> will soon be releasing a new Python package!</p>
<p><i>This site was written with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I'm a huge fan of this project and highly
recommend it for blogs: it is flexible and quick to get running. No more creating and uploading
.html files and links for each blog post! And no Javascript!!!</i></p>
